<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

（个人介绍）Welcome to my homepage! I am a graduate with a M.S. degree in Transportation Information Engineering and Control, Jilin University, advised by Zhaowei Qu(曲昭伟). Prior to that, I obtained my Bachelor’s degree in Automotive Application Engineering from Jilin University. 

My research focuses on developing the infrastructure of the next-generation artificial intelligence techniques to enhance its effectiveness and practical application in autonomous driving. I am particularly dedicated to creating flexible predictive models with multimodal and multi-agent learning, aimed at reducing the damage suffered by VRUs through the integration of traffic data.

You can reach me via email at tramasterxxx@gmail.com. 🤝 I am actively seeking collaborations in Autonomous driving-related domains! If you’re interested in AI applications in AVs, trajectory prediction, probability analysis, or any related fields, feel free to reach out! 📋 Note: I am currently applying for 2026 PhD programs! If you are interested in my background, I’d love to receive your guidance. Also always happy to chat over coffee!

# 🔬 Research Interests
- **Multi-scale pedestrian trajectory prediction model based on pedestrian cognition**: I am committed to developing human-centered, high-performance pedestrian trajectory prediction models capable of analyzing multi-agent interactions and capturing complex surrounding scenes to provide more accurate and robust behavior predictions.

# 🌱 Long-term Vision
I aspire to to become  a compound talent who master large-scale traffic data, multi-modal learning, and end-to-end autonomous driving applications. My long-term goal is to bridge the gap between cutting-edge artificial intelligence research and real-world traffic environments, driving technological innovation and product commercialization. Ultimately, I hope to ensure the safety of VRUs, reducing casualties and economic losses while bringing broader societal benefits.

**DPIU: Dynamic Pedestrian Intention Understanding Through Cognitive Decision-Making**

**Jiaheng Xiao**, Zhihui Li, Yu Sun, Mingxin Wang, Yu Xie, Qin Ma, Xin Wang

-  The proposed DPIU framework links future intentions to historical experiences, and, grounded in cognitive decision-making mechanisms derived from human physiology, is designed to predict pedestrian motion by inferring inherent movement intentions.
- The method substantially improves predictive performance in dynamic scenarios, providing a valuable tool for autonomous driving applications.
