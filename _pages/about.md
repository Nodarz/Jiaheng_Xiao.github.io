（个人介绍）Welcome to my homepage! I am a graduate with a M.S. degree in Transportation Information Engineering and Control, Jilin University, advised by Zhaowei Qu(曲昭伟). Prior to that, I obtained my Bachelor’s degree in Automotive Application Engineering from Jilin University. 

My research focuses on 


You can reach me via email at tramasterxxx@gmail.com. 🤝 I am actively seeking collaborations in Autonomous driving-related domains! If you’re interested in AI applications in AVs, trajectory prediction, probability analysis, or any related fields, feel free to reach out!

📋 Note: I am currently applying for 2026 PhD programs! If you are interested in my background, I’d love to receive your guidance. Also always happy to chat over coffee!

**DPIU: Dynamic Pedestrian Intention Understanding Through Cognitive Decision-Making**

**Jiaheng Xiao**, Zhihui Li, Yu Sun, Mingxin Wang, Yu Xie, Qin Ma, Xin Wang

-  The proposed DPIU framework links future intentions to historical experiences, and, grounded in cognitive decision-making mechanisms derived from human physiology, is designed to predict pedestrian motion by inferring inherent movement intentions.
- The method substantially improves predictive performance in dynamic scenarios, providing a valuable tool for autonomous driving applications.
